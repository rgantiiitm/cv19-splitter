# cv19-splitter


We are a group of engineers and designers who constantly develop and share to the public the VentilAid project, open source ventilator, that can be made anywhere locally with 3D printer and very basic parts. Ventilators are essential to keep breathing when faced with the complications of COVID19. This project contains all the required 3D files to print out splitters for ventilators. This will help to increase the number of patients being treate using a single ventilator. 


These files are provided at no liability. Please consult your doctor and you will have to use these at your own risk. Please visit http://covidindiainitiative.org/ for more details.
